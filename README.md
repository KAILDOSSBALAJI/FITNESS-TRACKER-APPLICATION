This Java Swing application is a Fitness Tracker designed to log and monitor workout activities,
track BMI, and motivate users. The app has a graphical user interface (GUI) with multiple sections: 
an input panel for logging workouts, a display panel for listing logged workouts, a health monitoring
panel for updating weight and calculating BMI, and a motivational panel showing encouraging messages. 
Users can log workouts by providing the type, duration, and calories burned, which are stored in a 
list and displayed in a scrollable area. It also allows users to update their weight, calculates their
BMI, and categorizes it as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. Motivational messages appear after
logging a workout, selected randomly from predefined messages. The app ensures robust input validation 
and provides error messages for invalid data, making it user-friendly and practical for fitness tracking.
